## 6. Tips for Efficiency

To maximize your productivity on the Invoices page, consider these tips:

*   **Utilize Search and Filter:** Instead of manually scrolling through long lists, use the search bar and filter options to quickly locate specific invoices or groups of invoices. This is especially useful for large datasets.

*   **Sort Columns:** Click on column headers like 'Due Date' or 'Invoice Amount' to sort your invoices. This helps in identifying overdue payments or high-value invoices at a glance.

*   **Adjust Items per Page:** If you prefer to see more invoices on a single screen, adjust the 'Items per Page' setting (40) to a higher number. This reduces the need for frequent page navigation.

*   **Regularly Sync Data:** Use the 'Sync History' button (23) to ensure your invoice data is always up-to-date, especially if you are integrating with external systems or have multiple users accessing the platform.

*   **Automate Reminders:** Leverage the 'Send Reminder' feature (22) to automate payment reminders. This saves time and ensures consistent follow-up with customers, improving your collection rates.
